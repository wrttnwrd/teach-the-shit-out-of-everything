# LLM Wiki

A personal knowledge base maintained by Claude Code.
Based on Andrej Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern.

## Purpose

This wiki is a structured, interlinked knowledge base for a company called Green Slaad Enterprises. The wiki keeps track of all relevant content, including third-party content clipped from the web or elsewhere.

This wiki should support the company's initiative to teach the shit out of everything (TTSOOE).

Whenever I mention TTSOOE, reference `ttsooe.md` for relevant definitions and information.

This wiki's job is to help surface and answer the questions our audience may have.

Claude maintains the wiki. The human curates sources, asks questions, and guides the analysis.

## Folder structure

```
raw/          -- source documents (immutable -- never modify these) 
raw/[subfolders] -- there may be subfolders in raw/. The same rules apply - these folders are immutable
wiki/         -- markdown pages maintained by Claude
wiki/questions.md -- a list of customer questions we can answer
wiki/index.md -- table of contents for the entire wiki
wiki/log.md   -- append-only record of all operations
```

## Ingest workflow

When the user adds a new source to `raw/` or subfolders and asks you to ingest it:

1. Read the full source document
2. Check for comments in the Markdown. Those are notes explaining aspects of the document
3. Discuss key takeaways with the user before writing anything
4. Create a summary page in `wiki/` named after the source
5. Create or update concept pages for each major idea or entity
6. Add wiki-links ([[page-name]]) to connect related pages
7. Update `wiki/index.md` with new pages and one-line descriptions
8. Append an entry to `wiki/log.md` with the date, source name, and what changed
9. If you find new, unanswered audience questions, add them to `wiki/questions.md`

A single source may touch 10-15 wiki pages. That is normal.

## Page format

Every wiki page should follow this structure:

```markdown - includes yaml frontmatter

---
title: title of page
date created: date created
last modified: data page last modified
Claude model: Claude model used to generate this page
---

# Page Title

**Summary**: One to two sentences describing this page.

**Sources**: List of raw source files this page draws from.

**Last updated**: Date of most recent update.

## Content

Main content goes here. Use clear headings and short paragraphs.

Link to related concepts using [[wiki-links]] throughout the text.

## Related pages

- [[related-concept-1]]
- [[related-concept-2]]
```

## Citation rules

- Every factual claim should reference its source file
- Use the format (source: filename.pdf) after the claim
- If two sources disagree, note the contradiction explicitly
- If a claim has no source, mark it as needing verification

## Question answering

When the user asks a question:

1. Read `wiki/index.md` first to find relevant pages
2. Read those pages and synthesize an answer
3. Cite specific wiki pages in your response
4. If the answer is not in the wiki, say so clearly
5. If the answer is valuable, offer to save it as a new wiki page

Good answers should be filed back into the wiki so they compound over time.

## Briefs

If I ask for content briefs, put them in the `/briefs` folder as Markdown.

## Lint

When the user asks you to lint or audit the wiki:

- Check for contradictions between pages
- Find orphan pages (no inbound links from other pages)
- Identify concepts mentioned in pages that lack their own page
- Flag claims that may be outdated based on newer sources
- Check that all pages follow the page format above
- Report findings as a numbered list with suggested fixes

## Rules

- Never modify anything in the `raw/` folder
- Always update `wiki/index.md` and `wiki/log.md` after changes
- Keep page names lowercase with hyphens (e.g. `machine-learning.md`)
- Write in clear, plain language
- When uncertain about how to categorize something, ask the user
